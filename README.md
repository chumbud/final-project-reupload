# Game Design Final

This is a explorable type game made in Unity 5 for my Game Design course at Rutgers.

### About

The objective of this project for me was to learn more about color and lighting as it pertains to a 3D space. As well as learning how to somewhat maintain a narrative by creating a setting and establishing an aesthetic to compliment it. I had a lot of fun making a sp00py scary scene with pretty colors. :)


This repository is a reupload of the previous branch of my first terrain project for repo disk space reasons. You can see past commits and progress here: https://github.com/de-Mote/babys-first-terrain/tree/final-project
