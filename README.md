# Game Design Final

This is a explorable type game made in Unity 5 for my Game Design course at Rutgers.

### About

The objective of this project for me was to learn more about color and lighting as it pertains to a 3D space. As well as learning how to somewhat maintain a narrative by creating a setting and establishing an aesthetic to compliment it. I had a lot of fun making a sp00py scary scene with pretty colors. :)
